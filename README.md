    players, starting from the 1950s to recent seasons. The dataset includes various player performance metrics like points per game, assists, rebounds, shooting 
    percentages, and more. Its purpose is to provide analysts and researchers with a comprehensive view of player performances across different eras of NBA history, enabling 
    comparisons and trend analysis over time
